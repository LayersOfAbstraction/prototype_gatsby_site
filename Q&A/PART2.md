- **Whatâ€™s the difference between a page component and a building-block component?**

**A page component:**

1. Is a combination of building block components into a singular page component for the entire page using a Content Management System like Word Press or a Static Site Generator like Gatsby.

2. It is generated by the CMS/SSG.

3. Using page components on other pages gives you a different version of the section of the previous page. The content can be uniquely different with it's IDs that prevent conflicts with other pages with the same copy-and-pasted page components.

**A building block component:**

1. Is a dynamic reusable component that is smaller than page components as they represent part of a page's UI and not the whole page.
2. Navbar, Sidebar, ProductGrid, and ProductCard components are examples of building-block components.
3. You can combine several smaller building block components into a larger page component.

- How do you add a new page to your Gatsby site?

You have to create a page component which can have only one container element, i.e HTML `div` tag or otr semantic tags such as `nav` or `section`.

- **What are the three steps for writing a new React component?**

If you are from a C# background or similar object orientated backgrounds like Java or Python then you will know you can import namespaces in C# at the top of the class with the `using` declaration next to the namespace. It is similar in React. Instead of namespaces we can "import" components at the top of the page in step one. We can then declare it in step 2 and then export the component in step 3.

```jsx
// Step 1: Import React
import * as React from 'react'
// Step 2: Define your component
function Portfolio = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <title>My projects are awesome</title>
      <h1>Hire me!</h1>
      <p>I have made a bug tracker!</p>
      <p>I have made technical talks.</p>
      <p>I have contributed to several repos and had my pull request accepted
      by Mozilla!</p>
    </header>
  )
}
// Step 3: Export your component
export default Portfolio
```

- **What are props and when might you use them?**

Properties are dynamic components. We will call them component props. They make the application more maintainable by changing the way a component renders.

Props are arguments for component functions just like Javascript has parameters for functions and opposing arguments outside it when it is being called.

Therefore they can change the way components renders. Properties can be passed into your component as parameters.

Components can only take a single parameter. So it for example this.

```jsx
// src/components/my-ShoppingList.js
const ShoppingList = (props) => {
  return(
    <p>Item: {props.myItemName}</p>
  )
}
```

And when you render the ItemName component you can pass in the `ItemName` with actual values from another component.

```jsx
const Items = () => {
  return (
    <section>
      <ShoppingList myItemName="Brocoli">
      <ShoppingList myItemName="Apples">
      <ShoppingList myItemName="Bread">
  )
}
```

- What is the children prop and why is it useful?

If you come from an Object Orientated Programming paradigm, know that you can have components with `children` components that inherit their properties, this is where the concept of parameters can get confusing. We will get to that part soon.

So Rect can create certain props for your components automatically. `children` props so to speak.

The component below will render dynamic content for the `pageTitle` prop

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'
const Layout = ({ pageTitle, children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <title>{pageTitle}</title>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <main>
        <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
        {children}
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
export default Layout
```

Notice on the 3rd line that the syntax is different. Yes I know we said there can only be 1 parameter per a component in React and that is still the case here. Those curly braces inside those parenthesis represent multiple properties of that singular parameter.

That is a JavaScript technique known as destructing. A shortcut for defining variables based on an object's properties. It's a bit like a C# constructor. We are setting up the value of the variables `pageTitle` and `children` and passing those values into our parent component, `Layout`.

`{prop, prop2}`

Think for a moment that you have a painting canvas. And on that canvas, you have a picture. We may have many pictures on that Canvas (component).
Notice we are importing a picture component into our canvas which will be a children component of the canvas parent component.

And you will see we are passing values into the component between the Picture opening and closing tags.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Picture from '../components/picture'
const canvas = () => {
  return (
    <Picture>
      <p>This will be passed in as children</p>
    </Picture>
  )
}
export default canvas
```

Now if you look at the below code what you see in the `h1` tag is going to be passed into the `canvas` component. Really anything between the `div` tag containing the `{ children }` prop means that will be passed to the canvas.

```jsx
import React from `react`

const Picture = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is the page title</h1>
        { children}
      </div>
  )
}
export default Picture
```

And if we run the program this would be the output.

```html
<div>
  <h1>This is the page title</h1>
  <p>This will be passed in as children</p>
</div>
```
