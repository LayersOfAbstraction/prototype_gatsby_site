- How do you get data into the data layer?

First we need to understand what is the data layer in Gatsby. It is a getter system that pulls data into our Gatsby site from different sources where it lives. 

It could exist in a folder, a CMS, a database. It could come from many backend sources.

It helps keep your blogs modular and attach them to what ever server side hosting platforms out there. 

Your client might have the data from their business about Sporting equipment hosted say on Shopify. 

Let's say they have partnered with a much larger entity who may be hosting a database on a Mysql database on AWS. 

Rather than the large entity having to port their database over to their partner's shopify website or vise versa. 

We can keep the data modular by simply pulling the information from those 2 different systems into our data layer.
